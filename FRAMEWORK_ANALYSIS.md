- **PerformanceAnalysisAgent** - Evaluates ad performance and suggests improvements
- **MutationAgent** - Evolves ads based on performance data
- **VoiceAgent** - Handles conversational business onboarding

### Integration Points

- **OpenAI API** - GPT-4 for ad generation and analysis
- **Meta Marketing API** - Facebook/Instagram campaign management
- **Real Demographics Data** - 1200+ Meta interest categories with IDs
- **WebSocket Support** - Real-time updates and monitoring
- **File Upload** - Asset management for ad creatives

## 🔄 Complete Workflow

### 1. Business Onboarding
```
Voice Agent → Business Profile Creation → Industry Analysis → Goal Setting
```

### 2. Demographic Analysis
```
Business Profile → AI Analysis → Real Meta Data Mapping → Segment Creation
```

### 3. Ad Generation
```
Segments + Business Profile → OpenAI Generation → Multiple Variants per Segment
```

### 4. Review Process
```
Generated Variants → Tinder-Style Interface → Approve/Reject/Regenerate
```

### 5. Campaign Launch
```
Approved Variants → Meta API → Campaign Creation → Live Publishing
```

### 6. Evolution Cycle
```
Performance Monitoring → Trend Analysis → Mutation → A/B Testing → Optimization
```

- **Meta Demographics Data** - 1200+ real interest categories with IDs

## 📊 Data Assets

### Demographics Database (`demographics_list.json`)
- 1200+ real Meta interest categories
- Each entry contains name and Meta API ID
- Categories span: Technology, Food, Sports, Entertainment, Business, etc.
- Direct mapping to Meta's targeting system

### Sample Categories
```json
{
  "name": "Small business (business & finance)",
  "id": "6002884511422"
},
{
  "name": "Digital marketing (marketing)",
  "id": "6003127206524"
}
```

## 🎯 Integration Strategy for Next.js App

### Backend Service Architecture
The agentic framework should be packaged as a FastAPI backend service that exposes:

1. **REST API Endpoints**
   - `/api/business/profile` - Business onboarding
   - `/api/demographics/analyze` - Segment generation
   - `/api/ads/generate` - Variant creation
   - `/api/ads/review` - Approval workflow
   - `/api/campaigns/launch` - Meta publishing
   - `/api/performance/metrics` - Analytics

2. **WebSocket Endpoints**
   - `/ws/generation` - Real-time ad generation updates
   - `/ws/performance` - Live campaign metrics
   - `/ws/evolution` - Mutation notifications

3. **Data Models Alignment**
   - Match TypeScript interfaces in Next.js app
   - Consistent API response formats
   - Proper error handling and validation

### Frontend Integration Points
The Next.js app expects these service integrations:

1. **Ad Service** - CRUD operations for ad management
2. **Processing Service** - Job queue for generation tasks
3. **Analytics Service** - Performance metrics and reporting
4. **Agent Service** - Chat and voice interactions

## 🚀 Next Steps for Integration

1. **Create Isolated Core Module** - Extract production-ready components
2. **Design API Interface Layer** - FastAPI service matching Next.js expectations
3. **Implement Data Serialization** - Bridge Python/TypeScript models
4. **Setup Configuration Management** - Environment and deployment settings
5. **Write Integration Documentation** - API specs and usage guides
6. **Package for Deployment** - Docker, requirements, and scripts

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- API key management for OpenAI and Meta
- Rate limiting for external API calls
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure WebSocket connections
- Campaign budget controls and limits

## 📈 Performance Optimization

- Async/await patterns throughout
- Connection pooling for external APIs
- Caching for demographic data
- Background job processing
- Real-time monitoring and alerting

This analysis provides the foundation for creating a clean, production-ready agentic backend service that integrates seamlessly with the Next.js frontend application.
